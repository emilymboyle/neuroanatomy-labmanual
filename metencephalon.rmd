#  The Metencephalon

In this laboratory session, we will study the anatomy of the human metencephalon. The metencephalon is the embryonic part of the hindbrain that differentiates into the pons and the cerebellum. It contains a portion of the fourth ventricle and the trigeminal nerve (CN V), abducens nerve (CN VI), facial nerve (CN VII), and a portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII).

Below, you will be presented with a number of figures and asked to label or color certain structures in each figure.
