The cerebrum or telencephalon is a large part of the brain containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In the human brain, the cerebrum is the uppermost region of the central nervous system. The prosencephalon or forebrain is the embryonic structure from which the cerebrum develops prenatally. In mammals, the dorsal telencephalon, or pallium, develops into the cerebral cortex, and the ventral telencephalon, or subpallium, becomes the basal ganglia. The cerebrum is also divided into approximately symmetric left and right cerebral hemispheres. Below, you will be presented with a number of figures and asked to label or color certain structures in each figure. 4.1 A Series Of Coronal Sections Of A Human Brain In Figure 4.1, label the following structures: The cingulate sulcus The cingulate gyrus The corpus callosum The lateral ventricle The caudate nucleus The insula The lateral sulcus The superior temporal gyrus The superior temporal sulcus The middle temporal gyrus The middle temporal sulcus The inferior temporal gyrus The inferior temporal sulcus The putamen The nucleus accumbens The optic nerves (left and right) The septum pelucidum The septal nuclei The internal capsule The external capsule The entorhinal cortex The parahippocampal gyrus Figure 4.1: Coronal section from The Human Brain Atlas at the Michigan State University Brain Biodiveristy Bank which acknowledges their support from the National Science Foundation.

The midbrain or mesencephalon is the forward-most portion of the brainstem and is associated with vision, hearing, motor control, sleep and wakefulness, arousal (alertness), and temperature regulation. The name come from the Greek mesos, “middle”, and enkephalos, “brain”) The principal regions of the midbrain are the tectum, the cerebral aqueduct, tegmentum, and the cerebral peduncles. Rostrally the midbrain adjoins the diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus, etc.), while caudally it adjoins the hindbrain (pons, medulla and cerebellum). In the rostral direction, the midbrain noticeably splays laterally. Below, you will be presented with a number of figures and asked to label or color certain structures in each figure. 6.1 A Series Of Coronal Sections Of A Human Brain In Figure 4.6, label the following structures: The cerebral aqueduct The pons Figure 4.6: Coronal section from The Human Brain Atlas at the Michigan State University Brain Biodiveristy Bank which acknowledges their support from the National Science Foundation.

["the-spinal-cord.html", "8 The Spinal Cord 8.1 A Series of Coronal Sections Of A Human Brain And Spinal Cord 8.2 Spinal Cord Dissection 8.3 A Series of Coronal Sections Of A Human Brain", " 8 The Spinal Cord In this laboratory session, we will study the anatomy of the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular structure made up of nervous tissue, which extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column. It encloses the central canal of the spinal cord, which contains cerebrospinal fluid. The brain and spinal cord together make up the central nervous system (CNS). In humans, the spinal cord begins at the occipital bone, passing through the foramen magnum and entering the spinal canal at the beginning of the cervical vertebrae. The spinal cord extends down to between the first and second lumbar vertebrae, where it ends. The enclosing bony vertebral column protects the relatively shorter spinal cord. It is around 45 cm (18 in) in men and around 43 cm (17 in) long in women. The diameter of the spinal cord ranges from 13 mm (1⁄2 in) in the cervical and lumbar regions to 6.4 mm (1⁄4 in) in the thoracic area. Below, you will be presented with a number of figures and asked to label or color certain structures in each figure. 8.1 A Series of Coronal Sections Of A Human Brain And Spinal Cord In Figure 4.10, label the following structures: The vermis The cerebellum The inferior olive The spinal cord Figure 4.10: Coronal section from The Human Brain Atlas at the Michigan State University Brain Biodiveristy Bank which acknowledges their support from the National Science Foundation.
