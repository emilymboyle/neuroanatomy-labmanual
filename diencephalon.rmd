#  The Diencephalon

In this laboratory session, we will study the anatomy of the human diencephalon. The diencephalon is a division of the forebrain (embryonic prosencephalon), and is situated between the telencephalon and the midbrain (embryonic mesencephalon). It consists of structures that are on either side of the third ventricle, including the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the epithalamus and the subthalamus.

Below, you will be presented with a number of figures and asked to label or color certain structures in each figure.
